Challenge Description : [Task and datasets](https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge)

## Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands, a leading player in the Indian hospitality industry for two decades, has been experiencing a decline in market share and revenue within its luxury hotels. This decline is attributed to competitor moves and management decisions. To counter these challenges, the managing director has decided to integrate "Business and Data Intelligence." In the absence of an in-house analytics team, the decision was made to hire a third-party to extract insights from historical data. The primary goal is to revitalize AtliQ Grands' market presence and revenue.

## Solution
To address the challenges faced by AtliQ Grands, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of historical data using Power BI. The aim was to unveil insights crucial for making informed decisions and ultimately contribute to the rejuvenation of the company's market presence and revenue.

## Tasks Accomplished
1. Created metrics based on the specified metric list.
2. Developed a dashboard aligning with the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
3. Generated additional insights beyond the given metric list/mock-up dashboard.

## Key Learnings
1. Mastery of DAX measures and calculated columns.
2. Proficiency in data cleaning and formatting using Power Query.
3. Skillful dashboard beautification.
4. Effective use of bookmarks for seamless page navigation.
5. Successful deployment to the Power BI service.

This project not only addressed the immediate challenges faced by AtliQ Grands but also equipped me with valuable skills in Power BI and data analytics. The insights gained from this analysis are expected to contribute significantly to the company's strategic decision-making process.
